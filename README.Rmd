## STILL BEING DEVELOPED, NOT YET OPERATIONAL !!

The following command might work and will download and run the **web interface...** - shiny library is required.

shiny::runGitHub("rRINEX", "fpirotti", subdir = "data-raw/rtklibShinyApp/")

The goal of rRINEX is to provide simple tools to analyse your RINEX observation files and create plots.    


Some advantages is that it can use parallel reading of large files.


It tries to interface with [*RTKLIB*](http://www.rtklib.com){target=_blank}
, so you should download it and provide rRINEX with the path to the **bin** folder. 
Download the observation data of a CORS (continuous operating reference stations) network froma GNSS data archive in the net. For now it connects to a user-provided list of CORS repositories, using a templated string just like RTKLIB's URL_LIST.txt

## Installation    

You can install the released version of rRINEX from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("rRINEX")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("fpirotti/rRINEX")
```

## Examples

### Some benchmarking

Reading a 5 MB (uncompressed) observation file with a total of 900 epochs and
a total of 26701 readings takes **1.3s**
