# rRINEX

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of rRINEX is to provide simple tools to analyse your RINEX observation files and create plots.    


Some advantages is that it can use parallel reading of large files.


It tries to interface with [*RTKLIB*](http://www.rtklib.com){target=_blank}
, so you should download it and provide rRINEX with the path to the **bin** folder. 
Download the observation data of a CORS (continuous operating reference stations) network froma GNSS data archive in the net. For now it connects to a user-provided list of CORS repositories, using a templated string just like RTKLIB's URL_LIST.txt
